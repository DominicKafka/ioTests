The Wilke Lab carries out research in computational evolutionary biology, bioinformatics, and biostatistics. All our research is theoretical or computational, but we frequently collaborate with experimental groups. Much of our research addresses questions of molecular evolution, in particular about the evolution of viruses and the biophysical mechanisms of protein evolution. Other areas of interest are systems biology, metabolic modeling, and biostatistics.
