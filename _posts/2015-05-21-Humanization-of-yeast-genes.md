In the May 22 issue of Science Magazine, we are publishing an article on [systematic replacement of essential genes in baker's yeast with corresponding human orthologs.](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/348/6237/921.full) This work, spearheaded by the [Marcotte lab](http://www.marcottelab.org/) at UT Austin, demonstrates that almost 50% of these yeast genes can be replaced by their human counterparts, despite over a billion years of evolutionary divergence between humans and yeast. Wilke-lab postdoc [Austin Meyer](http://meyerlab.org/) contributed computational modeling to this study, and showed that continued selection for specific function can maintain replaceability despite substantial sequence divergence.

The UT Austin press release on this study is [available here,](https://cns.utexas.edu/news/partly-human-yeast-show-a-common-ancestor-s-lasting-legacy) and Science Magazine published a news feature on this study [here.](http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2015/05/yeast-can-live-human-genes)
