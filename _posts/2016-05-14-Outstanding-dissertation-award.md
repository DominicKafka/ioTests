Graduate student [Stephanie Spielman](http://sjspielman.org/) was awarded the university's [Outstanding Dissertation Award](https://twitter.com/texas_IB/status/729844233411035136). This award is the highest honor The University of Texas bestows upon its graduate students. Each year, three graduate students are honored, in three different areas. Stephanie won the award in [Mathematics, Engineering, Physical Sciences, and Biological and Life Sciences,](http://gradschool.utexas.edu/finances/awards/outstanding-dissertation-award) against steep competition from graduate students from all natural sciences and engineering. The other two areas in which awards are made are (i) Humanities and Fine Arts and (ii) Social Sciences, Business and Education.

Stephanie wrote and/or contributed to numerous [publications](http://wilkelab.org/publications/) while in the Wilke lab, and she graduated this spring. She will be joining the [Institute for Genomics and Evolutionary Medicine](http://igem.temple.edu/) at Temple University later this summer.
